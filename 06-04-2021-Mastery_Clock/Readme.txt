This a timer that will help you track total time spent on a project.
Every time you start it, it will begin from where it last left off, it will also tell you
on which day how long you spent and what task you spent it on.

Current known bugs: It will start from 1 second instead of 0 in this Github version as I wasn't able to upload blank .txt files which are used to read in time from. To overcome this issue I added in '1' second into /time_files/total_time_list_raw.txt. If the reset button is used within the application it will overwrite this.
